  <h2>About me:</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a 19 years old student, intended to learn JavaScript because
    the browser is a very popular program and the only language
    that it can execute is JavaScript so I'm sure it's well worth spending time on it.
    I haven't got any job so far and gained all my programming experience from the university projects.
    I've built utility that generates flowchart based on a source code in the first year of education
    and compiler for my toy programming language in the second one. As you can see I love compilers.
    Aside from programming achievements related to my university studies I've created a
    <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8340">pull request</a>
    to
    Babel and it has even been merged.
  </p>

  <h2>Skills:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Basic HTML and CSS</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>
    I've learned English at school and programming at university.
    Haven't taken any extra courses in either of them.
